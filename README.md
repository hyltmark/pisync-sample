Unfished codebase and this application is not working yet.




CAUTION, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
This application will execute shell commands on your remote machine. 
Altough they have been tested and working on my Raspberry PI.
I suggest that you go through all commands that are executed on remote, 
in "./configs/runtimes.json" before you start using this application.

Requirements
  Runtime JS   
    On remote: 
      Only required if you need start/stop [background] (run in background) or autostart
        - Install https://github.com/Unitech/pm2
        - sudo pm2 startup

Supported Runtimes
  -NodeJS
  -Add more. See appendix.

Use Guide (OSX)
    
  1. Install pisync globally: "npm install -g ./".  
  2. Go to your project. Run "pis init".
  3. "./pisync.json" has been created in the root folder of your project. Add missing details in this file.
  5. For passwordless login: Add your public key to the Raspberry PI authorized_keys. See Appendix for help. 
  5. Go!

COMMANDS
  Run "pis -h"
  
APPENDIX
 
  Add public key to the Raspberry PI
    1. Create rsa key: https://www.drupal.org/node/1070130
    2. Copy key to the Raspberry PI:
      -https://github.com/beautifulcode/ssh-copy-id-for-OSX
      OR MANUALLY:
      -http://mpolaczyk.pl/raspberry-pi-series-part-2-ssh-public-key-authentication/
      
      

  Add more runtimes
    1. Add runtime in ./configs/runtime.js
    2. Add commands in ./configs/commandgroups/newruntime/ (See node/ as example)      
    
    
      var $ = {
    projectConfig: projectConfig,
    notifier: notifier,    
    remote: {
      transferFile: transferFile,
      exec: ssh.exec,
      runCommands: runCommands      
    }

  };
